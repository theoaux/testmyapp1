        <div class="ui-block-b">Being in believers loveworld has been a wonderful experience. I always had the desire to share the gospel with others and lead many to Christ.This dream was not realized until I joined BLW campus ministry in August 2010. After the 2012 ICLWC, I was challenged by the new standards given to us by our Man of God, Rev Chris. I made up my mind not to have a cell membership strength less than twenty-five.I spent time to speak in tongues, envisioned how my cell would be and I spoke words forth by the spirit .I also took time to review the cell ministry manual and other pastors messages concerning soul winning and the cell system. I started to reach out to souls from room to room in my catchment area. People responded to me like never before and many of them gave their lives to Christ and got filled with the Holy Ghost. They joined the cell and fellowshiped with us well. It was so inspiring seeing them win other people, growing in their giving and functioning in various departments in the church. I was so fulfilled to see these souls now totally transformed and my cell membership strength kept on increasing. I pioneered a total of 6 new cells within one year. Now I am a senior cell leader. Praise God!!The word works!!!</div>

        <div class="ui-block-b">Believers LoveWorld Campus Ministry has been a tool of change in my life, it has taken me from one level of glory to another, i have experienced tremendous growth in everything that pertains to me. The word of God that I have been hearing, the words that my pastor, Pastor Afolabi Oketunji has been sharing with me over the years, it has really produced results in my life. The words have made me, a new me and I can boldly stand in any congregation, anywhere with my head held high and proclaim the word of God and show it forth in everything that I do. I thank God because the same opportunity is coming to every other youth out there because of the work of the Campus Ministry. I thank God for the vision of our Pastor, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome.
